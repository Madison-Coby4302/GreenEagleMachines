Madison Granger and Coby Gage - Eagle Earth

The Website In General
	Since me and Coby are members of Eagle Earth, we decided it would be a cool idea to make a well designed and fully functioning website for the club. The original page for the club on our school’s website does not show what the club is all about, so we wanted to make a website the goes more in depth about the club. Before we got into coding the website, we wanted to figure out what pages we wanted on the website and then we wireframed all the pages of our website.

The Website’s Design 

     Since Mrs. Crouse let us design most of the website we decided to go with a grey, black, and light green color scheme. I thought i would be a good idea to have a picture of a wooden side of one of their gardens as a background picture. Mrs. Crouse wanted purple cone flowers as the header, so we picked the perfect picture of them for the header. She wanted us to not go so fancy on the fonts for the website, she preferred something like Comic Sans, so we used Comic Sans for the website.

Home Page
	
	The Home page provides a paragraph explaining what the club is about so for the people who visit the website would get a bit of an understanding of the club and everything else that is going on in the website. We thought that adding news to the side column of the home page would be a good idea. We decided to use “What’s Happening On Eagle Earth” for the news title.

Projects Page 

     For the Projects page, we wanted to provide what tasks the club members have every time the Eagle Earth Club meets and explain what they are doing/accomplishing by using pictures and descriptions of the pictures. Since we had more time to work on this website, we put a JavaScript slideshow to best show all the pictures. This page shows that this club does more than old style gardening.

Philosophy Page

The Philosophy page shows what Eagle Earth provides for its members, at first it was a Pictures page, but we already had a page that shows pictures of the club, so instead we added the philosophy onto the website.

Members Page
	
	The Members page shows the people who are apart of Eagle Earth using a group photo of the club and naming all of them by rows. We also included names of the people that were not in the photo. We decided to not put any columns on this page, so we could place the rows of the names the way we wanted to place them.

Contact Page

	The Contact page provides Mrs. Crouse’s contact information, so if anyone who has questions about the club can contact her about it. We thought it would be a cool idea to add the location of the school using google maps on the side column.

Donations Page

	The Donations page shows all the people who have donated to the club and the top donators. It has the Donators/ Top donators on the main column, and what the club needs donated to them on the side column.

Our Struggles 

We have had many difficulties when it came to making this website. Starting out on the website was a slow process due to the way we wanted our columns for our home page at the time. We also kept making small errors a lot, like typos, at the beginning of the project as well, but it happened less as we went on into the project.We also had problems putting the pictures, we had taken, onto the website. We ended up finding a website called Post Image that helped resolve that problem. We also struggled making the website responsive for mobile and tablets/ smaller computers, but we eventually figured out how to make it responsive.
